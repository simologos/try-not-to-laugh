When it is a player's turn, he chooses a maximum 30 second video snippet to be played to the other players. The system detects if one of the players has to laugh. If this happens, the player who has "played" the video receives one point for each player laughing. After 5 rounds the game is finished. The winner is the player who has the most points.
